# ***particleTransport***
particleTransport is a collection of Python codes for the implementation of cellular automaton algorithms for particle transport:
* Hopping Mechanism only
* Hopping Mechanism with tunneling
* Hopping Mechanism with backscattering

## ***Dependencies***
These codes are fully on python. Hence, we only need some specific packages that will be used by the code. These packages are <a href = "https://numpy.org" target = "_blank">numpy</a>, <a href = "https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target = "_blank">random</a>, and <a href = "https://pytorch.org" target = "_blank">matplotlib</a> for visualization of results.

## ***Installation***
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/lybesabe/particleTransport.git
```
